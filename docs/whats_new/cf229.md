## Enabling SSL connections for Oracle in WebEngine

You can now enable Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) database connections for Oracle in the WebEngine server. Before configuring the WebEngine server, ensure that SSL connections are enabled on the Oracle server.  
For more information, see [Manage WebEngine SSL database connections](../deploy_dx/manage/working_with_compose/db_over_ssl.md#connecting-webengine-to-oracle-over-ssl). <!-- URL will work once this PR is merged to main -->

## Enabling WAB to support SSL-secured websites

You can now configure the Web Application Bridge (WAB) to integrate with external websites secured by self-signed certificates not directly trusted by browsers. To enable secure connections, add the self-signed certificate to the truststore. For more information, refer to [Integrating WAB with DX Compose](../deploy_dx/manage/cfg_dx_compose/wab_integration.md).

## User Session Reporting Tool - Removed `-productFeatureIdName` as a command-line parameter

In the User Session Reporting Tool, `productFeatureIdName` has been removed as a command-line parameter. The `productFeatureId` will now be read from the License Manager’s environment variable instead of being passed in the command. For more information, refer to [Configuring MHS file-based session reporting](../getting_started/download/configure_entitlement_checks/configuring_mhs_file_base_session_reporting.md).
