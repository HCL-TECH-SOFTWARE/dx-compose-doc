## Enable SSL connections for Oracle in WebEngine


You can now enable Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) database connections for Oracle in the WebEngine server. Before configuring the WebEngine server, ensure that SSL connections are enabled on the Oracle server.  
For more information, see [Manage WebEngine SSL database connections](../deploy_dx/manage/working_with_compose/db_over_ssl.md#connecting-webengine-to-oracle-over-ssl). <!-- URL will work once this PR is merged to main -->


## Enable WAB to support SSL-secured websites


You can now configure the Web Application Bridge (WAB) to integrate with external websites secured by self-signed certificates. To enable secure connections, add the self-signed certificate to the truststore.  
For more information, see [Integrate WAB with DX Compose](../deploy_dx/manage/cfg_dx_compose/wab_integration.md).


## Remove `-productFeatureIdName` parameter from User Session Reporting Tool


The `-productFeatureIdName` command-line parameter has been removed. The `productFeatureId` is now read from the License Manager’s environment variable.  
For more information, see [Configure MHS file-based session reporting](../getting_started/download/configure_entitlement_checks/configuring_mhs_file_base_session_reporting.md).
