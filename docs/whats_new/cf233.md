## OpenLiberty and JRE versions

HCL DX Compose 9.5 CF233 contains the following:

- OpenLiberty 25.0.0.10
- Java Runtime Environment IBM Semeru Runtime Open Edition 21.0.8.0 (build 21.0.8+9-LTS)

## Using `authFilter` for XMLAccess and Search V2 redirection in OIDC

Documentation is now available for the `authFilter` element introduced in CF225. This authentication filter allows you to exclude XMLAccess and seedlist endpoints from OIDC authentication, ensuring configuration scripts and seedlist requests are not redirected to the OIDC provider. For more information on how to add this filter to your DX Compose environment, refer to [Enabling OIDC authentication in DX Compose](../deploy_dx/manage/cfg_webengine/configure_compose_to_use_oidc.md#enabling-oidc-authentication-in-dx-compose).
