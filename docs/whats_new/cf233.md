# What's new in CF233

The following features and updates are available to customers installing HCL Digital Experience (DX) Compose Container Update CF233 on supported platforms:

- OpenLiberty and JRE versions
- Using `authFilter` for XMLAccess and Search V2 redirection in OIDC

## OpenLiberty and JRE versions

HCL DX Compose 9.5 CF233 contains the following:

- OpenLiberty 25.0.0.10
- Java Runtime Environment IBM Semeru Runtime Open Edition 21.0.8.0 (build 21.0.8+9-LTS)

## Using `authFilter` for XMLAccess and Search V2 redirection in OIDC

Use the `authFilter` element (introduced in CF225) to exclude XMLAccess and seedlist endpoints from OIDC authentication. This configuration ensures that scripts and Search V2 requests process locally instead of redirecting to the OIDC provider. For more information on how to add this filter to your DX Compose environment, refer to [Enabling OIDC authentication in DX Compose](../deploy_dx/manage/cfg_webengine/configure_compose_to_use_oidc.md#enabling-oidc-authentication-in-dx-compose).
