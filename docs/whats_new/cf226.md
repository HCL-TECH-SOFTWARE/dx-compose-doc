## Documentation for using custom certificates

Documentation for [Using custom certificates in WebEngine](../deploy_dx/manage/working_with_compose/custom_certificates.md) is now available. This topic provides the steps on how to add custom certificates to the WebEngine server configuration through the Helm `values.yaml` file.

## MyHCLSoftware delivery portal

HCL DX software is now available through the new [MyHCLSoftware portal](https://my.hcltechsw.com/){target="_blank"} for customers licensed for the HCL Digital Experience Compose v9.5 offering. This in parallel to the existing HCL Software License Portal delivered in FlexNet. For more information, see [Download software](../getting_started/download/index.md).

## DX Compose software now available in Harbor

Customers with entitlements to HCL Digital Experience Compose 9.5 may access the DX Compose container images and Helm charts from the [HCL container repository on Harbor](https://hclcr.io/){:target="_blank"}. Customers with credentials to access entitled software on the HCL Software Licensing Portal can apply those credentials to optionally access these components of DX Compose v9.5. For more information, see [Downloading and deploying DX Compose from a Harbor repository](../getting_started/download/harbor_container_registry.md).

## Documentation for using Docker Compose

Instructions on how to deploy HCL DX Compose 9.5 for non-production purposes using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/){target="_blank"} is now available. For more information, see [Docker Compose for HCL DX Compose](../deploy_dx/install/docker_compose.md).

## Performance sizing guidance now available

Results of DX sizing tests for rendering in a small Kubernetes configuration are now available. This guidance presents the key performance indicators (KPIs) and discusses how adjustments to the pod configuration can make improvements in the responsiveness of the system. For more information, see the topics [Performance Sizing Guide for Kubernetes Deployments](../guide_me/performance_tuning/index.md) and [Sizing guidance for rendering in a small-sized Kubernetes configuration](../guide_me/performance_tuning/kubernetes/rendering_small_config.md).

## Search V2 enabled by default

By default, Search V2 is enabled for DX Compose when the parameter `configuration.searchMiddleware.enabled` is set to `true` in the HCL DX Deployment Helm chart. For more information, see [Enabling Search V2](../deploy_dx/manage/cfg_dx_compose/enable_search.md).

## People Service and Search V2 integration

You can integrate [People Service](https://help.hcl-software.com/digital-experience/9.5/latest/extend_dx/integration/people_service/){target="_blank"} with [Search V2](https://help.hcl-software.com/digital-experience/9.5/latest/build_sites/search_v2/){target="_blank"} to enhance user discoverability and search performance. With this integration, you can access user profile data with real-time synchronization. For more information, see [People Service and Search V2 integration](../deploy_dx/manage/cfg_dx_compose/enable_people_service.md#people-service-configuration).

## Presentation Designer - Canvas settings

Canvas settings are now available in Presentation Designer. With these settings, you can configure various aspects of the presentation such as canvas dimensions, direction, zoom level, and orientation. For more information, see [Accessing Presentation Designer](https://help.hcl-software.com/digital-experience/9.5/latest/manage_content/wcm_authoring/presentation_designer/access/){target="_blank"} and [Canvas settings in Presentation Designer](https://help.hcl-software.com/digital-experience/9.5/latest/manage_content/wcm_authoring/presentation_designer/usage/canvas_settings/){target="_blank"}.

## DXClient - New limitations for LiveSync

New limitations are documented for using LiveSync. For [Themes](https://help.hcl-software.com/digital-experience/9.5/latest/extend_dx/development_tools/dxclient/dxclient_artifact_types/livesync/#themes){target="_blank"}, if files are deleted from the DX server while the LiveSync process is in progress, the files will not be restored from the local system. For [WCM Design Library](https://help.hcl-software.com/digital-experience/9.5/latest/extend_dx/development_tools/dxclient/dxclient_artifact_types/livesync/#wcm-design-library){target="_blank"}, if files from the WCM library are deleted from the DX server by a concurrent user during the LiveSync process between the local and DX servers, the files will not be restored from the local system, and there will be no local indication of this deletion. Steps on how to resolve these limitations to the LiveSync process are provided.
