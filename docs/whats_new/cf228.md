# What's new in CF228

The following features and updates are available to customers installing HCL Digital Experience (DX) Compose Container Update CF228 on supported platforms:

- Transient users feature now available in DX Compose

- Customization of the DX Compose WebEngine image is now supported

- Sample HCL Java Authentication and Authorization Service modules now available

- Enabling SSL connections for DB2 in WebEngine now available 

## Transient users feature now available in DX Compose

You can now enable transient users in HCL DX Compose when using an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider. Transient users are authenticated externally through the OIDC provider and do not require a corresponding entry in the local DX Compose user registry. This allows users managed by an external identity provider to access DX Compose without duplicating their accounts locally. For more information, refer to [Configuring transient users in DX Compose with OpenID Connect](../deploy_dx/manage/cfg_webengine/configure_transient_users.md).

## Customizing the HCL DX Compose WebEngine image

Custom jars and related files can be added to an existing official HCL DX Compose WebEngine image and the customized image deployed in your environment. For more information refer to [Customizing the HCL DX Compose WebEngine image](../deploy_dx/manage/cfg_webengine/customize_webengine_image.md).

## Configuring JAAS modules for use with transient users in DX Compose

While enabling transient users allows external OIDC users to log in, custom Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) login modules can provide further integration. This includes mapping additional user attributes from the OIDC provider to the DX user session or assigning transient users to specific DX groups based on OIDC claims. For more information refer to [Configuring JAAS modules for use with transient users in DX Compose](../deploy_dx/manage/cfg_webengine/configure_jaas_modules.md).

## Enabling SSL connections for DB2 in WebEngine now available

You can now enable Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) database connections for DB2 in the WebEngine server. Before configuring the WebEngine server to connect to DB2 over SSL, you must enable SSL connections on the DB2 server. For more information, refer to [Managing WebEngine SSL database connections](../deploy_dx/manage/working_with_compose/db_over_ssl.md).
