# What's new in CF228

The following features and updates are available to customers installing HCL Digital Experience (DX) Compose Container Update CF228 on supported platforms:

- Transient users feature now available in DX Compose
- Enabling SSL connections for DB2 in WebEngine now available

## Enabling SSL connections for DB2 in WebEngine now available

You can now enable Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) database connections for DB2 in the WebEngine server. Before configuring the WebEngine server to connect to DB2 over SSL, you must enable SSL connections on the DB2 server. For more information, refer to [Managing WebEngine SSL database connections](../deploy_dx/manage/working_with_compose/db_over_ssl.md).

## Transient users feature now available in DX Compose

You can now enable transient users in HCL DX Compose when using an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider. Transient users are authenticated externally through the OIDC provider and do not require a corresponding entry in the local DX Compose user registry. This allows users managed by an external identity provider to access DX Compose without duplicating their accounts locally. For more information, refer to [Configuring transient users in DX Compose with OpenID Connect](../deploy_dx/manage/cfg_webengine/configure_transient_users.md).
