# What's new in CF232

The following features and updates are available to customers installing HCL Digital Experience (DX) Compose Container Update CF232 on supported platforms:

- HAProxy custom headers now available
- Presentation Designer - Direction-specific styling for bidirectional text layouts

## HAProxy custom headers now available

You can now configure custom HTTP headers in the HAProxy configuration through the HCL DX 9.5 Helm chart. You can add new headers and remove existing headers from responses generated by HAProxy. For more information refer to [Configure Networking - HAProxy custom headers](../deploy_dx/install/kubernetes_deployment/preparation/mandatory_tasks/prepare_configure_networking.md#haproxy-custom-headers).

## Presentation Designer - Direction-specific styling for bidirectional text layouts <!--Update internal link to external link-->

Override styles now support direction-specific styling for bidirectional text layouts through the **Canvas direction toggle** in the Presentation Designer header. This allows you to create distinct styles for RTL (Right-to-Left) and LTR (Left-to-Right) text directions. For more information, refer to [Override stylesheet](https://pages.git.cwp.pnp-hcl.com/CWPdoc/dx-mkdocs/in-progress/manage_content/wcm_authoring/presentation_designer/usage/default_and_override_stylesheet#override-stylesheet){target="_blank"}.
