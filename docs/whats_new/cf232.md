# What's new in CF232 

The following features and updates are available to customers installing HCL Digital Experience (DX) Compose Container Update CF232 on supported platforms:

- `abort_container` function for critical failures in custom scripts now available
- DX Picker - Configuring dialog size and persisting last known location
- Dynacache invalidation domain configuration
- HAProxy custom headers now available
- Presentation Designer - Direction-specific styling for bidirectional text layouts
- OpenLiberty and JRE versions

## `abort_container` function for critical failures in custom scripts now available

You can now use the `abort_container` function in custom scripts to stop container startup when a critical failure is detected. For example, your script can invoke this function when it identifies missing required configuration, unavailable external dependencies, or failed validation checks. For more information, refer to [Using the `abort_container` function for critical failures](../deploy_dx/manage/cfg_webengine/customize_webengine_image.md#using-the-abort_container-function-for-critical-failures).

## DX Picker - Configuring dialog size and persisting last known location 

You can now add the `size` attribute to your `dx-picker` function to change dialog dimensions. You can set this attribute to:

- `md` or `medium`
- `lg` or `large`
- `xl` or `extra-large`

Additionally, DX Picker now saves the selected item's last known location and displays it automatically when reopened. This saved location persists until the session ends or expires. For more information, refer to [Accessing DX Picker](https://help.hcl-software.com/digital-experience/9.5/latest/manage_content/wcm_authoring/dx_picker/access/){target="_blank"} and [Selecting an item](https://help.hcl-software.com/digital-experience/9.5/latest/manage_content/wcm_authoring/dx_picker/usage/#selecting-an-item){target="_blank"}.

## Dynacache invalidation domain configuration

You can now change the domain or schema used for the dynacache invalidation table in DX Compose. This table synchronizes dynacache updates across pods. By default, the `INVALIDATION_TABLE` is created in the `RELEASE` domain. To specify a different domain (such as `JCR`, `COMMUNITY`, or `CUSTOMIZATION`), override the `db.cache.invalidation.domain` property in the `ConfigService.properties` file. For more information, refer to [Changing the domain or schema for the dynacache invalidation table in the database](../deploy_dx/manage/working_with_compose/cfg_parameters/update_invalidation_domain.md).

## HAProxy custom headers now available

You can now configure custom HTTP headers in the HAProxy configuration through the HCL DX 9.5 Helm chart. You can add new headers and remove existing headers from responses generated by HAProxy. For more information refer to [Configure Networking - HAProxy custom headers](../deploy_dx/install/kubernetes_deployment/preparation/mandatory_tasks/prepare_configure_networking.md#haproxy-custom-headers).

## Presentation Designer - Direction-specific styling for bidirectional text layouts 

Override styles now support direction-specific styling for bidirectional text layouts through the **Canvas direction toggle** in the Presentation Designer header. This allows you to create distinct styles for RTL (Right-to-Left) and LTR (Left-to-Right) text directions. For more information, refer to [Override stylesheet](https://help.hcl-software.com/digital-experience/9.5/latest/manage_content/wcm_authoring/presentation_designer/usage/default_and_override_stylesheet/#override-stylesheet){target="_blank"}.
