# What's new in CF230

The following features and updates are available to customers installing HCL Digital Experience (DX) Compose Container Update CF230 on supported platforms:

- Deploying and configuring EAR-based themes and WCM plugins
- Customized DX Compose WebEngine images with custom scripts
- Enabling OIDC SSO for HCL Leap and HCL DX Compose Integration
- Support for using SQL Server version 2022 when using Amazon RDS
- New sizing guidance for rendering in a large configuration

## Deploying and configuring EAR-based themes and WCM plugins

You can now deploy and configure Enterprise Archive (EAR)-based themes and Web Content Manager (WCM) plugins for use in DX Compose deployments. For more information, refer to the following topics:

- [Deploying and configuring EAR-based themes](../deploy_dx/manage/cfg_webengine/deploy_ear_theme.md)
- [Deploying and configuring WCM plugins](../deploy_dx/manage/cfg_webengine/deploy_wcm_plugins.md)

## Customized DX Compose WebEngine images with custom scripts

You can now add custom shell scripts to specific plugin directories within the WebEngine container. These scripts can be configured to run during two key events:

- Scripts that run every time the container starts.
- Scripts that run when a new CF is applied, which is useful for tasks that need to be performed only during an update.

This new capability gives you more control over your DX Compose deployments, allowing for custom automation and configuration (such as registering an EAR-based theme) directly within the WebEngine container. Refer to [Customizing the HCL DX Compose WebEngine image with custom scripts](../deploy_dx/manage/cfg_webengine/customize_webengine_image.md) for more information.

## Enabling OIDC SSO for HCL Leap and HCL DX Compose integration

You can now enable Single Sign-On (SSO) using the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol when integrating HCL DX Compose with HCL Leap. The OIDC protocol is natively supported since both applications run on Open Liberty. The protocol connects directly to the preferred Identity Provider (IdP), such as Azure AD, Keycloak or Okta. By configuring DX and Leap to trust your central IdP, users get a seamless, single log-in experience. For more information, refer to [Configuring HCL DX Compose and HCL Leap SSO with OIDC - Implementing OIDC SSO](../deploy_dx/manage/cfg_dx_compose/configure_sso/integrating_leap_sso/index.md#implementing-oidc-sso).

## Support for SQL Server version 2022 when using Amazon RDS

DX Compose now supports SQL Server version 2022. For more information on this database, including its custom setup script, refer to [Using an external database and database transfer](../deploy_dx/manage/cfg_webengine/external_db_database_transfer.md).

## New sizing guidance for rendering in a large configuration

Results of DX Compose sizing tests for rendering in a large Kubernetes configuration are now available. This guidance presents the key performance indicators (KPIs) and discusses how adjustments to the pod configuration can make improvements in the responsiveness of the system. For more information, refer to the [Sizing guidance for rendering in a large-sized Kubernetes configuration](../guide_me/performance_tuning/kubernetes/rendering_large_config.md).
