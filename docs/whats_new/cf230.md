# What's new in CF230

The following features and updates are available to customers installing HCL Digital Experience (DX) Compose Container Update CF230 on supported platforms:

- Deploying and configuring EAR-based themes and WCM plugins
- Enabling OIDC SSO for HCL Leap and HCL DX Compose Integration

## Deploying and configuring EAR-based themes and WCM plugins

You can now deploy and configure Enterprise Archive (EAR)-based themes and Web Content Manager (WCM) plugins for use in DX Compose deployments. For more information, refer to the following topics:

- [Deploying and configuring EAR-based themes](../deploy_dx/manage/cfg_webengine/deploy_ear_theme.md)
- [Deploying and configuring WCM plugins](../deploy_dx/manage/cfg_webengine/deploy_wcm_plugins.md)

##  Customized HCL Digital Experience (DX) Compose WebEngine images ith custom scripts

 This new feature, available starting with CF230, allows you to extend the WebEngine's functionality. You can add custom shell scripts to specific plugin directories within the WebEngine container. These scripts can be configured to run during two key events:

- Scripts that run every time the container starts.
- Scripts that run when a new CF is applied, which is useful for tasks that need to be performed only during an update.

This new capability gives you more control over your DX Compose deployments, allowing for custom automation and configuration (such as registering an EAR-based theme) directly within the WebEngine container. Refer to [Customizing the HCL DX Compose WebEngine image](../deploy_dx/manage/cfg_webengine/customize_webengine_image.md) for more information.
## Enabling OIDC SSO for HCL Leap and HCL DX Compose Integration

You can now enable Single Sign-On (SSO) using the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol when integrating HCL DX Compose with HCL Leap. The OIDC protocol is natively supported since both applications run on Open Liberty. The protocol connects directly to the preferred Identity Provider (IdP), such as Azure AD, Keycloak or Okta. By configuring DX and Leap to trust your central IdP, users get a seamless, single log-in experience. For more information, refer to [Configuring HCL DX Compose and HCL Leap SSO with OIDC - Implementing OIDC SSO](../deploy_dx/manage/cfg_dx_compose/configure_sso/integrating_leap_sso/index.md#implementing-oidc-sso).
