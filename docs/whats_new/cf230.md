- Enabling OIDC SSO for HCL Leap and HCL DX Compose Integration

## Enabling OIDC SSO for HCL Leap and HCL DX Compose Integration

You can now enable Single Sign-On (SSO) using the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol when integrating HCL DX Compose with HCL Leap. The OIDC protocol is natively supported since both applications run on Open Liberty. The protocol connects directly to the preferred Identity Provider (IdP), such as Azure AD, Keycloak or Okta. By configuring DX and Leap to trust your central IdP, users get a seamless, single log-in experience. For more information, refer to [Configuring HCL DX Compose and HCL Leap SSO with OIDC - Implementing OIDC SSO](../deploy_dx/manage/cfg_dx_compose/configure_sso/integrating_leap_sso/index.md#implementing-oidc-sso).
