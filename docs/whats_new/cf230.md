# What's new in CF230

The following features and updates are available to customers installing HCL Digital Experience (DX) Compose Container Update CF230 on supported platforms:

- Deploying and configuring EAR-based themes and WCM plugins
- Enabling OIDC SSO for HCL Leap and HCL DX Compose Integration

## Deploying and configuring EAR-based themes and WCM plugins

You can now deploy and configure Enterprise Archive (EAR)-based themes and Web Content Manager (WCM) plugins for use in DX Compose deployments. For more information, refer to the following topics:

- [Deploying and configuring EAR-based themes](../deploy_dx/manage/cfg_webengine/deploy_ear_theme.md)
- [Deploying and configuring WCM plugins](../deploy_dx/manage/cfg_webengine/deploy_wcm_plugins.md)

## Enabling OIDC SSO for HCL Leap and HCL DX Compose Integration

You can now enable Single Sign-On (SSO) using the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol when integrating HCL DX Compose with HCL Leap. The OIDC protocol is natively supported since both applications run on Open Liberty. The protocol connects directly to the preferred Identity Provider (IdP), such as Azure AD, Keycloak or Okta. By configuring DX and Leap to trust your central IdP, users get a seamless, single log-in experience. For more information, refer to [Configuring HCL DX Compose and HCL Leap SSO with OIDC - Implementing OIDC SSO](../deploy_dx/manage/cfg_dx_compose/configure_sso/integrating_leap_sso/index.md#implementing-oidc-sso).
