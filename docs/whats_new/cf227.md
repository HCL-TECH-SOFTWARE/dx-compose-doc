## Content as a Service - Enabling CaaS in DX Compose

Documentation to enable Content as a Service (CaaS) pages in DX Compose is now available. The instructions for deploying CaaS to WebEngine differ from Core (Legacy) due to the lack of ConfigEngine in WebEngine. For more information, refer to [Setting up Content as a Service](../deploy_dx/manage/cfg_dx_compose/setup_cntnt_serv_pgs.md).

## DAM - Access Control Cache

The DAM Access Control Cache improves performance by reducing redundant access control checks with the Ring API. It caches responses with a configurable Time-to-Live (TTL) mechanism (default: 10 seconds) and optimizes efficiency by handling in-flight requests. For more information, refer to [DAM Access Control Cache](https://pages.git.cwp.pnp-hcl.com/CWPdoc/dx-mkdocs/in-progress/manage_content/digital_assets/usage/managing_dam/dam_access_control_cache/){target="_blank"}. <!--change to external links-->

## Search V2 - Added supported CSS part attributes for each Atomic Component

## User Session Reporting Tool - Updated the command to generate user session data usage in metrics format

User Session Reporting Tool parameters have been updated to allow all named parameters to be used in any order within the generate user session data usage command. You can now exclude multiple IPs and session keys by adding multiple `-excludeIP` or `-excludeSessionKey` parameters, respectively. The `-excludeIPs` and `-excludeSessionKeys` parameters have also been updated to exclude the `-excludeIP` and `-excludeSessionKey` parameters. For more information, refer to [Using the User Session Reporting Tool with My HCLSoftware](https://pages.git.cwp.pnp-hcl.com/CWPdoc/dx-mkdocs/in-progress/get_started/download/software_licensing_portal/configure_entitlement_checks/user_session_reporting_tool_non_kubernetes/){target="_blank"} and [User Session Reporting Tool](https://pages.git.cwp.pnp-hcl.com/CWPdoc/dx-mkdocs/in-progress/get_started/download/software_licensing_portal/configure_entitlement_checks/user_session_reporting_tool/){target="_blank"}. <!--change to external links-->
