# Kubernetes Deployment

The Kubernetes container platform allows orchestration features for the automated deployment, coordination, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Originally designed by Google, now governed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), and developed by Google, Red Hat, and many others, Kubernetes is now widely used by organizations of various sizes to run containers in a cloud environment.

Learn more about the container architecture, including the supported container platforms in deploying HCL Digital Experience images for your environment.

Whether developing, testing, or running a full production environment, use of Docker images and containers are preferred for the ease of deploying applications, including the latest version of HCL Digital Experience. Deploy in a fraction of the time than what it takes in the traditional deployment models.
