# Deploying WebEngine

This section provides information how to deploy the WebEngine container within your environment. Starting with environment preparation, this guide covers the deployment process, focusing on Helm-based deployments to Kubernetes environments. This section provides steps for installation, configuration, and uninstallation to ensure a smooth setup and maintenance of the service.

## Preparing the environment

The deployment of WebEngine is similar to HCL DX with Core container. Note that the Helm chart has some additional settings related to WebEngine.

For more information, see [Deploying using Helm](../../install/container/helm_deployment/overview.md) and [Preparation Before Installing with Helm](../../install/container/helm_deployment/preparation/index.md).

To create a site framework, you need to create site areas.
-   **[Editing page items](./pages/index.md)**  
Pages are created by using the Portal toolbar. If Managed Pages is enabled, a page item is created each time that a page is created in the portal. Pages cannot be created by using the authoring portlet, but you can use the authoring portlet to edit some properties of a page item.
