# Configure Harbor Helm Repository

The HCL Digital Experience (DX) Compose 9.5 container images and Helm charts can be accessed from the [HCL Harbor container repository](https://hclcr.io/){target="_blank"}. Customers with credentials to access entitled software on the [My HCLSoftware (MHS) portal](https://my.hcltechsw.com/){target="blank"} can apply those credentials to access these HCL DX Compose 9.5 components.

The Harbor repository is updated with a registry based on Open Container Initiative (OCI) standards. The Helm chart command is updated to be OCI-compliant.

For more information on how to pull Helm charts using OCI commands and list available Helm chart versions, refer to [Downloading and deploying HCL products from a Harbor Repository](../../../../../getting_started/download/harbor_container_registry.md).
