# Configuring SSO in DX Compose

This guide explains how to set up Single Sign-On (SSO) between HCL DX Compose and HCL Leap. Both applications can be connected to a central Identity Provider (IdP) using the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol. This setup allows users and administrators to log in once and then switch between creating pages in DX Compose and designing forms in Leap without logging in again. This improves workflow efficiency and security.
