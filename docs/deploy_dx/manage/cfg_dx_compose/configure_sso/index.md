# Configuring SSO in DX Compose

This guide shows how to set up Single Sign-On (SSO) between HCL DX Compose and HCL Leap. Since both applications run on Open Liberty, we can easily connect them to a central Identity Provider (IDP) using the OIDC protocol. This setup allows business users and admins to log in just one time and then switch between building pages/components in DX and making forms in Leap without needing to log in again, making their workflow much simpler and more secure.
