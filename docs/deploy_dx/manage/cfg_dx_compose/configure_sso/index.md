# Configuring SSO in DX Compose

This guide explains how to set up Single Sign-On (SSO) between HCL DX Compose and HCL Leap. We can connect them to a central Identity Provider (IDP) using the OIDC protocol. This setup allows users and administrators to log in just one time and then switch between creating pages in DX Compose and designing forms in Leap without needing to log in again, improving workflow efficiency and security.
