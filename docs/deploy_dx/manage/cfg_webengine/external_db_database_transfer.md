title: Using an external database and database transfer
---

By default, WebEngine comes with a local Derby database included in the image and persisted in a PersistentVolume. You can use the Derby database to test the basic functionality of HCL Digital Experience (DX) Compose in a Kubernetes deployment. This works for single-Pod deployments. However, for production environments, it is required to use an external database for better performance and scalability. This document outlines the steps to connect to an external database and transfer the content of the Derby database to the external database in HCL DX Compose deployment.

!!! note
    For the currently supported external databases, refer to [Limitations](../../../getting_started/limitations.md).

## Setup external database (schema / user creation)

This section provides the custom scripts for setting up the external database schemas (or users).

|Database| Custom setup script|
|--------|--------------------|
|DB2|[DB2 custom setup script](SetupDb2DatabasesManually.sql)|
|Oracle|[Oracle custom setup script](SetupOracleDatabasesManually.sql)|

!!! Note
    If you are using Oracle RDS, you will need to configure the database to support XA transactions. In order to support XA transactions for WebEngine, you must remove the default option group. Refer to [Configure Custom Option Groups for Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.html){target="_blank"} for more information.

## Configuring an external database

The external database is configured in the Helm custom `values.yaml` file. You can add the values directly to the custom values file or you can reference them from secrets to hide the plain text entries that can contain credentials.

There are two sets of values used to configure the external database:

- `configuration.webEngine.dbDomainProperties`
- `configuration.webEngine.dbTypeProperties`

You can use the following secrets instead of the provided values:

- `configuration.webEngine.customDbDomainPropertiesSecret`
- `configuration.webEngine.customDbTypePropertiesSecret`

!!! note
    You must create the `customDbDomainPropertiesSecret` and `customDbTypePropertiesSecret` secrets before the deployment of the Helm chart. If the secrets are used, all property values set in the custom `values.yaml` file will be ignored. Therefore, all properties must be set in the secrets, not only the overridden ones.

### External database configuration in the custom `values.yaml` file

#### Sample `values.yaml` file for DB2

!!! note
    With DX Compose 9.5 CF226 the location of the DB2 library jar in the container is /opt/openliberty/wlp/usr/svrcfg/templates/jars/db2

    So the value for db2.DbLibrary is now /opt/openliberty/wlp/usr/svrcfg/templates/jars/db2/db2jcc4.jar

    The db2jcc_license_cu.jar is no longer provided or required.

### External database configuration in the custom secrets file

```yaml
configuration:
  webEngine:
    customDbTypePropertiesSecret: custom-credentials-webengine-dbtype-secret
    customDbDomainPropertiesSecret: custom-credentials-webengine-dbdomain-secret
```

Make sure to create the secrets before the deployment of the Helm chart. You must reference the secret names in the custom `values.yaml` file. To create the secrets, use the following commands:

```sh
kubectl create secret generic custom-credentials-webengine-dbtype-secret --from-file=dx_dbdomain.properties
kubectl create secret generic custom-credentials-webengine-dbdomain-secret --from-file=dx_dbtype.properties
```

Create the properties files with the same properties as in the custom `values.yaml` file in the format `key=value`. For example:

```properties
db2.DbDriver=com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver
db2.DbLibrary=/opt/openliberty/wlp/usr/svrcfg/bin/db2jcc4.jar:/opt/openliberty/wlp/usr/svrcfg/bin/db2jcc_license_cu.jar
db2.JdbcProviderName=wpdbJDBC_db2
```

### Changing the database configuration

To change the database configuration, update the custom `values.yaml` file or the custom secrets file with the new values and do a `helm upgrade`. When the database configuration is changed, a Pod restart is triggered automatically. This also applies when a new secret is created and referenced in the custom `values.yaml` file. If an existing secret is updated, you must restart the Pods manually after the secret is updated for the changes to take effect.

## Using the external database and triggering the database transfer

The external database is used by setting the `configuration.webEngine.useExternalDatabase` property to `true` in the custom `values.yaml` file and doing a  `helm upgrade`. This triggers a database transfer when enabled for the first time. The database transfer is a one-time operation that copies the content of the Derby database to the external database.

To drop and recreate all existing WebEngine tables in the external database when transferring the Derby data, set the `configuration.webEngine.dropDatabaseTables` property to `true` in the custom `values.yaml` file when doing the `helm upgrade` for the database transfer. WebEngine data that may exist in the external database will be lost. If you change the `configuration.webEngine.dropDatabaseTables` property to `true`, it is recommended to immediately reset it to `false` after your `helm upgrade`.  Failure to do so could lead to unexpected loss of data.
