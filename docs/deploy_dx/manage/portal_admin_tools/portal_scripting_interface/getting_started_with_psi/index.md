# Getting started with the Portal Scripting Interface

With the Portal Scripting Interface, you can administer your portal installation by executing commands. You can do that either interactively by typing the commands into a console window with interactive scripting and pressing the Enter key, or you can write the commands into a file and run that file. Here are some hints and examples for using the Portal Scripting Interface.

!!!note
    To simplify things, the following examples are based on a Linux portal installation in the directory /opt/WebSphere. If you use a different system or a different installation path, adopt the examples so.
