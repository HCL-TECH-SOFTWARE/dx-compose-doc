title: Managing users and groups in DX Compose
---

This guide provides instructions for configuring user registries and viewing users and groups in Digital Experience (DX) Compose. This covers how to define `basicRegistry` and `ldapRegistry` in the `server.xml` file, and how to view users and groups after the registry is configured.

!!!note 
    Creating, updating, and deleting users and groups are currently not supported.

## Configuring user and group management

To view users and groups, you must first configure your `server.xml` to include either a basic or LDAP registry. This configuration allows DX Compose to interact with the specified user information sources.

### Configuring basic registry

A basic user registry, which is a local, file-based repository, allows developers to set up a simple authentication system for testing application resource access. DX Compose offers a straightforward basic user registry tailored for use in development settings.

Developers can set up the basic user registry within the `server.xml` file. While it is not recommended for production use, this registry offers a convenient way to handle authentication and authorization for development and testing purposes. For example, by configuring a basic user registry with two users, their passwords, and a group assigned to the administrator role, developers can simulate how access control would work. This setup enables testing of application resource access for different roles, such as an administrator, without the need for integrating with an external user registry.

The basic registry is suitable for development environments or scenarios where a simple user list is sufficient.

The following configuration defines a `basicRegistry` with a user and a group. The user admin is part of the `adminGroup`.

```xml
<server>    
    <basicRegistry id="basic" realm="SampleBasicRealm">
        <user name="admin" password="adminpwd" />
        <group name="adminGroup">
            <member name="admin" />
        </group>
    </basicRegistry>
</server>
```

### Configuring LDAP registry

LDAP is a widely recognized protocol that facilitates authentication and authorization services by defining how application servers should interact with LDAP directories. These directories hold crucial security data, including usernames, passwords, and group memberships. While a basic user registry may be adequate for the initial stages of application development and testing, transitioning to an LDAP user registry is advisable for enhanced security in production environments.

To enable DX Compose to handle authentication through an LDAP directory, it is necessary to incorporate both the Application Security and LDAP User Registry features into your `server.xml` configuration. Additionally, if your application needs to communicate securely with an LDAP server that uses TLS, you must include the Transport Security feature in your configuration featureManager.

Add the following configuration to define the `ldapRegistry`:

```xml
<ldapRegistry id="ldap" realm="LdapRealm"
              host="ldap.example.com"
              port="389"
              baseDN="dc=example,dc=com"
              bindDN="cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com"
              bindPassword="adminpassword"
              ldapType="Custom"
              ignoreCase="true"
              recursiveSearch="true">

</ldapRegistry>
```

Replace the placeholder values with the actual details of your LDAP server:

- `host`: LDAP server hostname
- `port`: LDAP server port
- `baseDN`: Base Distinguished Name for LDAP searches
- `bindDN`: Distinguished Name to bind to the LDAP server
- `bindPassword`: Password for the bind DN
- `ldapType`: Type of LDAP server (for example, Custom, AD)

!!!note
    If the LDAP server does not support recursive server-side searches, you can set the value of `recursiveSearch` to `true` to allow recursive searches for users.

For more information about using additional properties, see the [LDAP User Registry](https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/feature/ldapRegistry-3.0.html){target="_blank"} feature.


### Configuring Federated User Registry

When user and group data reside in various registries, DX Compose offers the capability to consolidate this dispersed information into a single, cohesive registry. This unified registry integrates data from different sources, including LDAP, basic, and custom user registries, into one centralized repository.

By default, if your `server.xml` file includes configurations for multiple basic, LDAP, or custom user registries, these are automatically unified under the [Federated User Registry](https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/feature/federatedRegistry-1.0.html){target="_blank"}  feature. This federation applies to LDAP user registries as well, whether they represent distinct data sources or are parts of the same LDAP directory.

The following configuration specifies the sample basic and LDAP registries to be included in the federation by referring to them by name within the `federatedRepository` element.

```xml
<federatedRepository>
    <primaryRealm name="PrimaryRealm" allowOpIfRepoDown="true">
        <participatingBaseEntry name="o=SampleBasicRealm"/>
        <participatingBaseEntry name="dc=example,dc=com"/>
    </primaryRealm>
</federatedRepository>
```

## Viewing users and groups

After the registry is configured, you can view users and groups through the Manage Users and Groups portlet.

1. Log in to HCL Digital Experience as an administrator.

2. Click the **Administration menu** icon. Then, click **Access > Users and Groups**.

To view detailed information about users, such as passwords, User IDs, first names, last names, email addresses, or preferred languages:

1. Use the search function to locate a specific user, or click the **All Authenticated Portal Users** link to see a comprehensive list of users.

2. Next to the user's name, click the pencil icon to view the user's detailed information.

!!!note
    Editing user profile information is currently not supported.

## Defining custom attributes

You can add multiple custom attributes at once or individually by specifying them in the `server.xml` file. For more information, refer to [Defining Custom Attributes](adding_custom_attributes.md).

## Limitations

- Write operations such as creating, updating, and deleting users and groups are currently not supported in DX Compose.
- You cannot assign attribute definitions to a user or group in a basic user registry.
- Nested group search is not supported.

More complex or less common scenarios that are supported in the WebSphere Application Server (WAS) have not been thoroughly tested with DX Compose and are not supported at this time. These include the following:

- Lookaside database
- Application groups
- Transient users
