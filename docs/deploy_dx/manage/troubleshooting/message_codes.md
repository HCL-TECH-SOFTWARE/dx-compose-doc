# Error message codes

Each message code consists of a product identifier, component identifier, a unique number, and a message type identifier. The product identifier is `EJP` and there are many components. There are three message types: error, information, and warning.

## Example

For the message code `EJPIC0001E`:

-   `EJP` is the product identifier.
-   `IC` is the component identifier which means installation user interface.
-   `0001` is the unique message number.
-   `E` is the message type which means error.

Clicking **Start Configuration** runs the configuration  automatically. To return to the automatic process, click **Resume Configuration**. Otherwise, click **Cancel** to run each remaining step manually.
