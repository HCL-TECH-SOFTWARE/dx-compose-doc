# Tips for searching the Help Center

This topic contains tips on how to improve your search results and find the information you need in the HCL Digital Experience (DX) Help Center.

Refer to the following sample search queries and how to use them:                        

- **fo***: Use this to find all the keywords beginning with 'fo'.
- **f*o**: Use this to find all the keywords that start with 'f' and end with 'o'.
- ***er**: Use this to find all the keywords ending with 'er'.
- **fo bar**: Use this to find the keywords beginning with 'fo' or 'bar'.
- **+far**: The search must contain 'far'.
- **-bar**: The search cannot contain 'bar'.
- **title:navigation**: Use this to find pages with page titles that contain 'navigation'.

## Combining queries to refine search results

You can combine search queries to further refine search results. For example:

- **+far +bar**: The search contains both 'far' and 'bar'.
- **+far -bar**: Use this to find every page with 'far' but not 'bar'.
- **+far -*er**: Use this to find every page with 'far' that does not have words ending with 'er'.
- **title:navigation -extension**: Use this to find all pages with the page title 'navigation' that do not have the word 'extension'.
