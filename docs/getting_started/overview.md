# DX Compose overview

Digital Experience (DX) Compose provides an updated Core container called WebEngine that runs on [Open Liberty](https://openliberty.io/){target="_blank"} instead of IBM WebSphere Application Server. The initial release is focused on running web content, custom Script Applications, and themes.

!!!note
    The ability to run custom Java portlets is planned for a DX Compose future delivery. This statement is not a guarantee of future releases or their features.

In addition, DX features such as Web Content Management (WCM), Personalization, secure and role-based delivery, virtual portals, Script Applications, Digital Asset Management (DAM), and Content Composer integration are available in the DX Compose product.

DX Compose is delivered as a set of container images and attached Helm charts to deploy to a Kubernetes system or Docker Compose. Note that DX Compose is not supported for a non-container installation.
