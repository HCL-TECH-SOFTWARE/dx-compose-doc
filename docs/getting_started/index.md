# Getting started with DX Compose

Digital Experience (DX) Compose is a cloud-native platform for delivering content-centric and transactional digital experiences. DX Compose includes a core container called WebEngine. The WebEngine container is built on the [Open Liberty](https://openliberty.io/){target="_blank"} platform to deliver fast-performing DX sites capable of using the latest Java Development Kit (JDK) and Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) levels.

DX Compose is released under the HCLSoftware Continuous Delivery Support Policy, and will be releasing incremental and cumulative updates to progressively provide new features and fixes.
