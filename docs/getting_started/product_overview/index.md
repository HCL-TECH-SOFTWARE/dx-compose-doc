# Overview

Dive into the foundational elements of the HCL Digital Experience Compose v9.5 product with this section. This section will introduce you to the service's architecture, core features, and requirements.

With DX Compose we provide an updated Core container, WebEngine, that runs on [Open Liberty](https://openliberty.io/){target="_blank"} instead of IBM WebSphere Application Server. The initial release is focused on running web content, custom script apps, and themes on WebEngine. The ability to run custom java applications and extensions is planned for a future delivery.

Digital Experience Compose is delivered as a set of container images and attached helm charts to deploy to a supported Kubernetes system or Docker Compose for development. DX Compose is not supported for a non container platform.

Note: In this release, instructions for use of select features will be located in the [HCL Digital Experience Help Center](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/digital-experience/latest/){target="_blank"}. These will be documented in the HCL Digital Experience Compose Help Center in future releases.
