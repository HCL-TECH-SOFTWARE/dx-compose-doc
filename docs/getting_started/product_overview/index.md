# Overview

Dive into the foundational elements of the HCL Digital Experience (DX) Compose v9.5 product with this section. This section introduces you to the service's architecture, core features, and requirements.

DX Compose provides an updated Core container called WebEngine, that runs on [Open Liberty](https://openliberty.io/){target="_blank"} instead of the IBM WebSphere Application Server. The initial release is focused on running web content, custom script apps, and themes on WebEngine. The ability to run custom Java applications and extensions is planned for a future delivery.

DX Compose is delivered as a set of container images and attached helm charts to deploy to a supported Kubernetes system or Docker Compose for development. DX Compose is not supported for a non-container platform.
